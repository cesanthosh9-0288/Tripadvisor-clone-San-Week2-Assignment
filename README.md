## 📝 Task Overview

### ✅ Set Up the HTML Document
- Created a structured HTML file with semantic tags.
- Divided the layout into key sections: `Header`, `Main Content`, and `Footer`.

### ✅ Header Layout
- Left-aligned **TripAdvisor logo**.
- Centered **search bar**.
- Right-aligned navigation: links like “Discover”, “Trips”, “Review”, “Sign In”.

### ✅ Navigation Menu
- Built a horizontal navigation menu using `<ul>` and `<li>`.
- Styled with CSS and added hover effects for interactivity.

### ✅ Main Content Area
- Used **Flexbox** to create multi-column and responsive grid-style sections.
- Sections include:
  - Featured destinations
  - Popular hotels
  - Top-rated restaurants

### ✅ Search & Filter Section
- Created a search bar for cities/destinations.
- Included filter dropdowns for price range and rating.

### ✅ Card Layout
  - Designed individual **cards** for listings:
  - Each includes an image, place name, title, rating, and price.
  - Used `flex-direction: column` for clean vertical stacking.

### ✅ Responsive Design
  - Applied **CSS Media Queries** for different breakpoints:
  - **Tablet (≤ 900px)**: Simplified layout, reduced text/image sizes.
  - **Mobile (≤ 480px)**: Stack elements vertically, hide less relevant items (e.g., navigation links), shrink images.
